# Host Discovery Method

## Steps
I used Virtualbox as my environment and created four machines that I configured the network that can communicate with each other. Kali Linux will be my scanner machine and Windows, Ubuntu, and Metasploit 2 will be my target machines. In Kali, I installed Nessus and started to turn on the other three machines. I assigned manually the IP addresses of each machine according to my preference for testing purposes.

*Kali Linux Ip: 192.168.10.2*<br>
*Ubuntu Linux Ip: 192.168.10.3*<br>
*Metasploit 2 Ip: 192.168.10.5*<br>
*Windows Ip: 192.168.10.1*<br><br>

I make sure that all machines can communicate with each other before performing scanning. I used _Nping_ command in my scanner machine to ping three machines at the same time.<br>

In my scanner machine (Kali), I open the Nessus tenable by starting the service first. Open the browser and go to the localhost of Nessus which is under port 8834 and log in to your account. You will be in the Nessus Graphical User Interface and you will see a lot of different scanning methods.<br>

I started the scanning with the host discovery method first to check which ports and services in each machine were open and to see any exploitable ports. Before I started scanning, I configured the settings to make sure I scanned the right machines. Under the settings tab, I labeled my scan as a Test scan and put the IP addresses of the target machines in the target box.<br>

The results that we gathered from scanning three machines using the Host Discovery method in Nessus were very clear that one machine has multiple open ports and that machine's IP address is 192.168.10.5 which is the Metasploitable 2 machine. I generated the results in PDF form so it can easily read and analyze the information. The Nessus information in the Host Discovery method that I used only provides port numbers without any information so I used Nmap to get more information about their services and names. I have included the versions too and their operating system. Figure 10 shows the result of the Nmap method with port numbers along with the state information that will tell us either open or closed. It has a service name and versions. You can customize your result in Nessus if you want to add some information by configuring settings. In my end, I only selected the default setting for the result. I generated the report from the Nessus in a PDF file to read easily. You can see the generated report below.
