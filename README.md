# Vulnerability Project

## Objective

This vulnerability scanning project aimed to establish a strong understanding of Vulnerability Management and have some hands-on experience on the Nessus tenable. The primary focus of this project was to:
Scan open ports in every machine.
Look for possible vulnerabilities using Nessus tenable tools.
Generate a vulnerability analysis report  that contains vulnerabilities in each machine.
Generate a remediation report that focuses on which one first and why.


## Skills Learned

- Vulnerability Scanning
- Network Scanning
- Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Assessment Report
- Linux OS

  
### Tools Used

- Nessus
- Nmap
- Kali Linux
- VirtualBox
- Msf Console
  

## Steps
I used Virtualbox as my environment and created four machines that I configured the network that can communicate with each other. Kali Linux would be my scanner machine and Windows, Ubuntu, and Metasploit 2 would be my target machines. In Kali, I installed Nessus and started to turn on the other three machines. I configure the IP addresses of each machine according to my preference for testing purposes. <br><br>

I make sure that all machines can communicate with each other before performing scanning. I used _Nping_ command in my scanner machine to ping three machines at the same time.<br>

In my scanner machine (Kali), I open the Nessus tenable by starting the service first. Open the browser and go to the localhost of Nessus which is under port 8834 and log in to your account. You will be in the Nessus Graphical User Interface and you will see a lot of different scanning methods.<br>
