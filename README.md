# Vulnerability Project

## Objective

This home lab project aimed to establish a strong understanding of Vulnerability Management and have some hands-on experience on the Nessus tenable. The primary focus of this project was to:
Scan open ports in every machine.
Look for possible vulnerabilities using Nessus tenable tools.
Generate a vulnerability analysis report  that contains vulnerabilities in each machine.
Generate a remediation report that focuses on which one first and why.





## Skills Learned

- Vulnerability Scanning
- Network Scanning
- Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Assessment Report
- Linux OS

  


### Tools Used

- Nessus
- Nmap
- Kali Linux
- VirtualBox
- Msf Console
  

## Steps
I used Virtualbox as my environment and created four machines that I configured the network that can communicate with each other. Kali Linux would be my scanner machine and Windows, Ubuntu, and Metasploit 2 would be my target machines. In Kali, I installed Nessus and started to turn on the other three machines. I configure the IP addresses of each machine according to my preference for testing purposes.
