# Vulnerability Scan Method (Basic Scan)
*Kali Linux Ip: 192.168.10.2*<br>
*Ubuntu Linux Ip: 192.168.10.3*<br>
*Metasploit 2 Ip: 192.168.10.5*<br>
*Windows Ip: 192.168.10.1*<br><br>

## Steps
I used Virtualbox as my environment and created four machines that I configured the network that can communicate with each other. Kali Linux will be my scanner machine and Windows, Ubuntu, and Metasploit 2 will be my target machines. In Kali, I installed Nessus and started to turn on the other three machines. I assigned manually the IP addresses of each machine according to my preference for testing purposes.
